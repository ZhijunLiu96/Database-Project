Database designMy database is designed by MongoDB.The database I created is library, which includes three collections. One is book_info, one is people, and the other is check_out.For the first collection book_info, there are columns including book_id, title, primary_author, secondary_author, date_of_1st_publish, number_of_page, publisher, translator, and topic. And each row is a JSON object. Attribute book_id and attribute number_of_page are in the format of integer, date_of_1st_publish is in the format of date,  topic is in the format of list, and others are in the format of character.For the second collection people, its columns are user_id, name, phone, address, and university_affiliation, and each row is a document. The data type of user_id is integer, and other data types are in the format of character.In order to get the check out information, I also created a collection check_out, which includes book_id, user_id, book_name, check_out_date, topic, user_name and university_affiliation. Each row is a JSON object. book_id, user_id are integer, check_out_data is date type, and others are character types.
